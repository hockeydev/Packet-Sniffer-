# Packet-Sniffer-
 A simple packet sniffer that can filter out selected information such as usernanmes and passwords but the 'keyword section' of the code can be altered to filter desired information. 
 
 Start the program by running it from the command line using python packet_sniffer.py , the program doesnt take any command line arguments but I will eb changing this to allow users to select an interface, for the time being it can be changed in the source code. 
 
 This tool was built using the scapy module to filter specific key words and sniff for packets.
